# Configure and Run the MovieList App
Our mobile application manages dependencies via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). Once you have Cocoapods installed, download or clone this application project to your machine. To install all the necessary dependencies from Cocoapods, run:
  
```sh
 pod install
 ```
  
  Open up the project from the Terminal with:
  
  `  open   MovieList.xcworkspace `
  
  Note that you are opening the `.xcworkspace` file rather than the xcodeproj file, like all Cocoapods applications. You will need to open your project this way every time.
  
  You should now be able to press play and run the project in the simulator.

  Once the app loads in the simulator, you  see a search option.
  
  Start search your favorite Movies - they should start appearing in the UITableView in the app.
  
  You can add movies to your favorite list and also hide as well.
  
  ###   Good luck and have fun!
